# This is a prototype Makefile. Modify it according to your needs.
# You should at least check the settings for
# DEVICE ....... The AVR device you compile for
# CLOCK ........ Target AVR clock rate in Hertz
# OBJECTS ...... The object files created from your source files. This list is
#                usually the same as the list of source files with suffix ".o".
# PROGRAMMER ... Options to avrdude which define the hardware you use for
#                uploading to the AVR and the interface where this hardware
#                is connected. We recommend that you leave it undefined and
#                add settings like this to your ~/.avrduderc file:
#                   default_programmer = "stk500v2"
#                   default_serial = "avrdoper"
# FUSES ........ Parameters for avrdude to flash the fuses appropriately.

# "-x assembler-with-cpp" should not be necessary since this is the default

# compatibility define the file type manually.

# If you have an EEPROM section, you must also create a hex file for the
